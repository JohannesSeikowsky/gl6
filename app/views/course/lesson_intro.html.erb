<h3 id="lesson_title"> Introduction to Learning Python & Programming </h3>
<!--
If someone came to me as a blank slate -
what would I first want them to know about programming itself -
and about the process of learning programming -
before starting with any specfics of Python or something else?

- therefore -
take what youve written as a first version that ok enough for ppl.
but it will probable need to be re-written etc eventually --
it could be better. But I thing the hurdle to  valuable has been taken -
but not the hurdle to being as good as it can be ...
which is also something that shouldnt be expected ...

<p>
This course is designed for any modern computer user, who
wants to acquire a useful understanding of what maybe called the "basics of programming".
<br> <br>
To achieve that purpose we are going to look at the Python programming language. The choice of Python as our programming language has two main reasons. Firstly, Python is, plainly put, a very nice language to write programs in - in my opinion that is. And secondly, Python is used in many, many different fields - data science, machine learning, game development, network programming - you name it. This is important, because chances are that you don't have a very clear understanding yet of what you want to work on in the future - what you want to use your programming skills for.  Given that circumstance, it seems wise to choose a language that has a wide range of applicability - a regard in which I know of no language superior to Python.

<br> <br>
One important thing to understand is that programming is a practical pursuit and not a theoretical subject.
Conceptually being a programmer is closer to being an architect or a painter than it is to being a Geologist or Historian. As a programmer, you are at your core a maker and a designer - a maker and a designer of programs, charged first and foremost with the task of conceiving and writing novel and useful programs.

<br> <br>
This is not to say that theory can be disregarded. On the contrary - acquiring a good understanding is indispensable. 
In particular acquiring a good understanding of your programming language of choice, as that language will be your main tool for writing programs. And in particular of the core concepts of that language, as many things further down the line will in turn be based on these core concepts.

<br> <br>
The understanding we're aiming at is however a practical one. In the same way that professional chefs may know a wide variety of ingredients and taste-patterns and such things in order to prepare good dishes, in that way programmers aim to know their language well in order to write good programs.

<br> <br>
That is why we are going to focus on theory as well as application.
I'm going to explain as clearly as I can the practically important core concepts of Python and how they relate to the practice of programming. But unlike most other courses, we are going to start work on an actual program that you actually want to write relatively soon. In fact, we are going to start as soons as possible. This project will probably be a small one at first, but it will be a genuine one. And, as said before, that is what programming is all about - writing good programs that actually do something useful.

<br> <br>
For that reason, I've put together the rest of the course in the following way. The next lesson will briefly deal with our setup for writing code using a very good website called Repl.it. This setup will be very simple - no need for installations or similarily tedious things. After that we are going to cover those Python concepts that in my opinion constitute the absolute minimum that one would need to know to start work on a small project. We will try to learn "the minium to be dangerous" so to speak, with each lesson being dedicated to one of the necessary concepts. Overall there are 8 such concepts and therefore 8 lessons. After that we are going to use one of our 1-on-1 sessions to guide you through the beginning stage of a coding project - coming up with an idea and getting started with the code. And after that I will provide continual practical assisstance and support throughout that project until it's done to a reasonable standard. 
<br> <br>

If all goes well, you will, by the end of it, have a reasonable hold on the basics of Python programming and thereby of computer programming in general and moreover have a project to show for - your first programming reference work.
<br> <br>

Regarding the 8 "theory" lessons that follow, each one will have 3 parts. One very brief, very high-level introduction to the concept that the lesson is concerned with, to give you a general idea. One video tutorial that dives into the details (8-12 minutes). And 3 practical tasks at the end that are designed to give you a chance to play around with code and internalize the content of the lesson.
<br> <br>

I recommend not skipping these practical tasks, because in programming there is a "muscle memory" of sorts, that develops only if you actually type out code, even if you don't totally understand that which you're typing.
I also recommend that you don't expect everything to make perfect intuitive sense on the first go. In programming things often take a while to sink in properly, and usually not because they are so incredibly complicated, but plainly because they can look so unfaimilar on the first encounter (and on the second encounter). 
So I would suggest not to worry excessively if things seem a little hazy at first, but instead proceeed and plan to revisit them once again later and maybe even once more after that. With every such round things will seem less hazy until they're pretty much obvious.
<br> <br>

Let's dive into it.






<!--

Each lesson has one short written intro to given the most general context, one video that dives into the detail, and 3 exercises for each lesson, basically repeating the content and giving you a change to play around a little bit.


each lesson will be dedicated to one of Python's core concepts. There are 12 of them. These 12 concepts do not constitute all concepts in Python, but they do represent the core of what you need to know in order to be able to do things. The minimum to be dangerous, so to speak. 

In fact learning that "minimum to be dangerous" is the name of our game for now.
All concepts beyond these central ones you can pick up naturally over time as you come to actually need them.

<br> <br>
I've also added two or three training exercise at the end of each lesson.
Their purpose is to give you an opportunity for easy practice.
In the real programming world there's no use for such uninteresting programs that don't actually do anything useful.
But for now we have to pay our dues and learn the basics.
<br> <br>
I would recommend that you do not expect to perfectly understand everything on
your first go through the course. In programming things can take a while to sink in. Often not because they are
necessarily very hard in themselves, but plainly because they look so unfamiliar on the first encounter (and second encounter). So, I believe a better plan would be to go through the course, including the exercises, once in a relatively quick manner to get a sort of rough and general overview. And then to do a second and maybe even a third "round" to let the ideas solidify.
