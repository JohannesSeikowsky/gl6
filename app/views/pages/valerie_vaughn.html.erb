	<h3 class="piece_header"> Finger Cuff </h3>		
	<p>
I’m allergic to wedding bands. It’s true. Once a girlfriend of mine insisted we wear commitment bands on our wedding ring fingers to show our love for one another. In a moment of clarity, less than a year later much to my chagrin, her proposal had more to do with her narcissistic personality disorder to make sure I was no longer an appetizer on the single menu than to do with her seriousness towards our enduring relationship. The rejection of the ring placement was spontaneous, as the finger cuff tightened around my ring finger while the restricted blood flow made my brain woozy from the darkness now threatening to consume my individual freedom. I was emotionally overwhelmed by an immediate need to remove the tiny, round handcuff from my single-forever finger. Full of fear, and breaking-out in a cold sweat, I began to shake my left hand vigorously, launching the circular metal missile into the bedroom wall where my would-be-captor proceeded to bounce off and spin in a vicious circle on the floor to find its final resting place under our empty bed.
<br><br>

I never once thought that I was going to like someone enough to even once ascertain the thought of one day marrying them. And, why would I? I refuse to apologize for not only knowing what I want in life but, who I want in my life. I am perfectly happy doing whatever it is I feel like doing, whenever I feel like doing it without my actions escalating into a screaming match due to my partner not being happy with my current choice. I do not feel it necessary to ask permission to engage in questionable behavior, the sideways glance look of disgust that I receive from my two dogs while I knock back several glasses of wine nightly, provides adequate condemnation that tells me my significant other will also find my life choices unpalatable to their taste. My bend-to-no-one will will cost me a few more relationships. My pragmatic self-awareness guides me through the relationship web as my Gemini intuitiveness aids in my immediate understanding if a potential mate is going to put up with my moody ass. The answer is usually a resounding, “No!” The restlessness I feel inside usually allows for ten years of an okay relationship, yet still, a relationship which probably needed to end several years sooner. After the seventh year, but before the tenth, the ugly head of the marriage beast shows itself, and I once again, find myself in a place where I am once again, backed into the corner of single-life, as tears rain down as if arrows whose sharpened points wildly scar as crazy love accusations rain down.
<br><br>
I’m unable to explain my lack of desire to marry in a way that lessens the hurt my partner feels after they realize it’s a pointless conversation to engage in. If there was ever a time for the “No, it’s not you, it’s me,” conversation, now is the time. I guess I just don’t see the point of marriage unless you desire to follow the traditional white picket fence route, a route which I find to be nothing more than an unappealing societal constraint applying its icing on the conformity cake. I have never, nor will I ever have the desire to reproduce. I enjoy sleep too much. I enjoy sleeping so much that I consider it a hobby. A child would certainly kill this hobby, as well as many other joys in my life such as binge-drinking and engaging in other questionable behaviors. People less self-aware would label me as selfish. Well, yes I am, but at least I am upfront and honest about my selfishness. I have no plans to mask it years later, while trapped in a convenience marriage with a tribe of screaming kids running around a two-story house in the suburbs.
<br><br>
When I discuss my desire to remain single and childless with my friends and family, I often find myself uttering the proverbial phrase, “It’s just not in the cards I was dealt.” It’s not that I am afraid of commitment, my last two previous relationships lasted well over ten years apiece. I feel it is more to do with losing the person I am becoming to a person which my partner needs me to be, and knowing, I am not the person which they seek. I am me. I am an educated, single, childless woman in her mid-forties, living in a world which devalues my value and tries repeatedly in its failed attempt to place a wedding ring on me. Yet, the older I get, the more I wonder if I should allow for the ring, and the mortgage, and the kids, and the stress, and all the extra heartache that goes with being alive, while asking myself, “Am I destined to remain single while hoping all along that the person of my dreams will make their appearance, and the world will begin to make sense?”

	A winding Virginia road.<br>
	An old country back road. <br>
	A road which leads me, <br>
	Home.
	<br> <br>
	Past everlasting trees. <br>
	Past pastures of manure, <br>
	Coloring each a deep green; <br>
	Weathered wooden fences, <br>
	Guide me, on my way, <br>
	Home.
	<br> <br>
	Mountains so high, <br>
	Surely I can reach their unbound skies. <br>
	Skies which surround the place <br>
	I call, <br>
	Home.
	<br> <br>
	Deep blue ponds. <br>
	Fishing hole fools. <br>
	Talking about the one that got away, <br>
	On our way, <br>

	<p>
	Our empty flat, in which I sit,
	<br> <br>
	feels like night even when it’s day.
	<br> <br>
	All my days seem like nights since we parted ways.
	<br> <br>
	The early morning winter winds blow negativity aside,
	<br> <br>
	there’s already five inches of snow on the ground
	<br> <br>
	with more headed in a direction which I must escape;
	<br> <br>
	I must make my way before I convince my mind to stay.
	<br> <br>
	I drive in the direction of a new life
	<br> <br>
	barely escaping my own holocaust life,
	<br> <br>
	my mental needle closely rests on empty,
	<br> <br>
	I try not run out of gas before I get out what’s inside my head,
	<br> <br>
	how quickly your love ran to another
	<br> <br>
	as the quiet survival of loneliness fuels me ahead.

	I try not to fold <br>

	be bold, <br>
	I am told <br>

	not to lose strength, <br>

	to lost to walk <br>
	to broken to surrender, <br>
	finding no truth <br>

	<p>
	I often wonder how different my life would have been <br> <br>
	had my mother not died when I was twenty-seven.<br> <br>
	Would my series of life mistakes even exist beyond just a bad dream;<br> <br>
	each a testament to my inability to chose wisely free of an inebriated state.<br> <br>
	Several bad decisions away, one ending with a ring on my left hand<br> <br>
	leading to false accusations and label lies.<br> <br>
	Time does not heal, that is a bullshit lie.<br> <br>
	Time does not lessen the pain of life.<br> <br>
	Time is never on one’s side, least of all mine.<br> <br>
	Silence slices the deafness of uncaring ears<br> <br>
	as each is not what the other one thought<br> <br>
	lost to uncompromising pride<br> <br>
	as once loved expectations die.

	<p>
	I was born two weeks overdue, <br>
	still early in life. <br>
	More time was needed in my mother’s womb, <br>
	more time to feel complete, <br>
	More time was needed in my mother’s womb, <br>
	and told to land on my feet. <br>
	Face forward <br>
	while the sting of the world whips me into its desired shape, <br>
	shift-changing, clock awakening <br>
	sunrise schedules my time to fit the workday <br>
	to type my day away for minimal pay <br>
	in a one percent society which does not represent me, <br>
	but likes to micro-manage me. <br>
	Time clock, punch-management <br>
	inaccurate directions impede my stride, <br> 
	retracting dreams from attainable echelon skies; <br>
	I rise not from sleep but from a deep understanding <br>
	as tides of fluid birth nourish my seed of growth. <br>
	I plant my feet firmly upon the soil of my soul, <br>
	fruition multiples as dreams become real <br>
	for the first time since birth,  <br>
	until I return to the knowledge-rich soil <br>
	to cultivate my soul’s rebirth.
